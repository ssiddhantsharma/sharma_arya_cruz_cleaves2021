### Figure Plotting Workflows
This repository holds the code used in Sharma et al., 2021 Automated Exploration of Prebiotic Chemical Reaction Space: Progress And Perspectives.to generate the Figure 2 and Figure 6. Using this material, one can replicate the figures created in our paper. Questions and feedback welcome! Please send any comments or questions to: Siddhant Sharma (siddhaantsharma.ss@gmail.com)
